 APL2 for Windows -- Version 2.0  -- Service Level 26 - May 2019
================================================================================

 To install service to APL2 for Windows:

  1. Shut down all running parts of APL2
  2. Download the service .EXE file in binary mode.
  3. Click the "Start" button, point to "Settings", and then click
     "Control Panel".
  4. Double-click "Add/Remove Programs".
  5. Click "Install".
  6. Click "Next".
  7. The installation program is the downloaded .EXE file.
     Click "Finish".

  Follow the instructions on your screen.

 Notes:

  - The service process must be performed from the same userid that
    performed the original product installation.

  - By default, the installation tool chooses the TCP/IP enabled
    version of the shared variable proceessor (apl2svp.dll).
    See the User's Guide or product README for information on
    switching if this is not the desired version.

  - After installing downloaded service, the service .EXE file may be deleted.

  - As of Service Level 13, in order to support objects that contain characters
    that are not in the APL2 atomic vector, the Library Manager and WSCOMP write
    Unicode files when using an external compare program. As a result of this
    change, you must select a compare program that supports Unicode, and you
    must configure it to use a font that contains Unicode APL2 characters (such
    as Courier APL2 Unicode).

 -  As of Service Level 12, AP 127 has been re-written to use the CLI
    interface to DB2*.  This interface does not use bind files.  The
    bind process, and the apldb2.bat file, are no longer required.
    The rewrite should generally be transparent to users, however, the
    following behavior changes may be noted:

    1. Implicit connection to the database via the DB2DBDFT environment
       variable is not supported.  CONNECT must be issued explicitly.
    2. In error conditions the SQLCODE reported may be different.
    3. Errors may not be given for certain type mismatch conditions
       (for example, passing a numeric value in a WHERE clause where
       to column type is character.) Instead, the value is simply
       treated as "not found".
    4. Character columns declared with binary attributes (such as BLOB
       and with the FOR BIT DATA clause) will accept only data that is
       passed to DB2 using binary types.  To force AP 127 to use binary
       types, use the :B form of the value indicator. For example, given
          INSERT INTO TABLE VALUES(:1, :B2, :3, :B4)
       AP 127 will use binary character datatypes to pass the data in
       the second and fourth positions.

  - Starting with Service Level 7, the APL2 system has been generated using
    the Microsoft Visual Studio** compiler instead of the IBM VisualAge*
    compiler.  This change will for the most part be transparent to
    APL2 users. However, please note the following:

    1. The online help for the session manager, editors and SVP monitor
       is in a new format.

    2. Environment variable HELP is no longer used to locate the online
       help.  Standard Windows search order and the PATH environment
       variable are used.

    3. Environment variable TZ is no longer required to determine the
       time zone.  If set, it will be used, but if not set, Windows
       operating system services will be used to determine the time
       zone.  Since the operating system services will more accurately
       reflect the latest policies on dates for changing to and from
       daylight saving time, we recommend that TZ not be set.

    4. Changes have been made to apserver.h so that it can be used
       with the new compiler, and the .lib files shipped with APL2
       (apl2svp.lib and apl2lib.lib) have been generated with the new
       compiler.  If you have C user-written AP's or use the Calls to APL2
       interface from C and have had to make special adjustments to your
       C code in order to use these files with a C compiler other than
       IBM VisualAge, the adjustments may no longer be necessary.

================================================================================
 Support for Windows 98 and Windows Me
================================================================================

 Support for Windows 98 and Windows Me was withdrawn in July 2006.
 Service Level 8 was the last APL2 service level that was tested on
 those systems.  Users still running Windows 98 and Windows Me should
 not install APL2 service beyond Service Level 8.

================================================================================
 Support for Windows 2000
================================================================================

 Support for Windows 2000 was withdrawn in July 2010.
 Service Level 16 was the last APL2 service level to be tested on that
 system.  Users still running Windows 2000 should not install APL2
 service beyond Service Level 16.

================================================================================
 Support for Windows XP
================================================================================

 Support for Windows XP was withdrawn on April 8, 2014.
 Service Level 21 was the last APL2 service level to be tested on
 that system.  Users still running Windows XP should not install APL2
 service beyond Service Level 21.

================================================================================
 Support for Windows Vista**
================================================================================

 Support for Windows Vista was withdrawn on April 11, 2017.
 Service Level 23 was the last APL2 service level to be supported
 that system. Users still running Windows Vista should not install APL2
 service beyond Service Level 23.

================================================================================
 Support for Windows 7
================================================================================

 Support for Windows 7 will be withdrawn in January 2020.
 Service Level 26 is the last APL2 service level to be tested and supported on
 that system.  Users still running Windows 7 should not install APL2
 service beyond Service Level 26.

================================================================================
 Support for Windows 8
================================================================================

 APL2 has been tested by customers on Windows 8.  No new problems
 have been reported, however all the notes below pertaining to Windows 10
 also apply to Windows 8.

 In addition, since Windows 8 does not have a Start menu, we
 recommend that when asked whether you wish an icon to be created on
 the desktop during the installation process, that you reply "yes".
 Otherwise navigation to the APL2 folder to start APL2 may be
 cumbersome.

================================================================================
 Support for Windows 10
================================================================================

 APL2 has been tested on Windows 10.  One new problem has been reported, with
 display of the APL2 Image font.  A workaround removing internal usage of APL2
 Image was shipped in Service Level 25.

 Notes:

  - In Windows 10, certain system directories are protected from write access.
    One of these is "C:\Program Files (x86)", the default installation
    directory for APL2.  If you install APL2 into that directory, you will
    not be able to use DOS commands via AP 100 or )HOST to access files there.
    APL2 library commands like )LIB and )SAVE and direct file access through
    other auxiliary and associated processors (AP 210, AP 211, P12) will still
    work, however file writes may be silently rerouted from the protected
    directories to directories in C:\Users.  This can cause confusion if
    you attempt to find or use files saved within APL2 from another program,
    as they may not be in the directory where you expect to find them.
    The Windows search facility may be used to find their location.

  - APL2 remains a 32-bit program.  It runs on 64-bit systems, but does not
    exploit them.  In addition, you cannot call 64-bit programs from APL2
    using Processor 11 or AP 145, and you cannot interface to 64-bit versions
    of programs when APL2 loads their DLL's to communicate with them.  For
    example, to call Rexx programs using Processor 10, the 32-bit version of
    Rexx must be used.


================================================================================
 Changes in Service Level 26
================================================================================

 Interpreter
    KOC2266  Refcount too high after )RESET via AP 101
    KOC2272  Support larger print width
    KOC2276  Unnecessary garbage collections during grade of integers

 Session Manager
    KOC2270  Memory leak after attempting insert into longest SM line
    KOC2271  No beep/message when insert into SM line reaches limit
    KOC2273  Memory leak when AP 101 string longer than max of PW


================================================================================
 Enhancements Added in Previous Version 2.0 Levels
================================================================================

 Namespaces
    The interpreter and Processor 11 have been enhanced to support
    encapsulation of APL2 workspaces into namespaces. Namespaces
    reside outside the active workspace, and objects in them are
    accessed using the QuadNA system function.

 Runtime Library
    The APL2 Runtime Library is now included with APL2 and may be
    re-distributed with user applications.

 Calls to APL2
  - The APL2 interpreter has been re-packaged into a shared library which
    is callable by other programs.  Specific support and documentation
    is provided for calling APL2 from the C and Java** environments.
  - Visual Basic** is added to the list of languages and programs that are
    supported by the APL2 Program Interface.  A set of subroutines is
    provided that can be called by Visual Basic as external procedures
    to start, manage and stop an APL2 session.
  - A new sample C program demonstrates using the APL2 Programming
    Interface to call APL2 from C.
  - APL2 is added to the list of languages and programs that are
    supported by the APL2 Program Interface.  An external function,
    APL2PIA, provides a synchronous call interface for managing APL2
    sessions. An auxiliary processor, AP 200, provides an asynchronous
    shared variable interface to the same facility.
  - On error, the execution stack is now available to the calling program.
    From APL2, the stack is always returned in the error result.
    From C, use the EXECUTE_APL_ESTACK callback service to enable
    this facility.
    From Java, examine the Stack field of the APL2exception class.
    From Visual Basic, use the GetStack function.

 Invocation
  - Support has been added for the use of a configuration file (.ini)
    to specify APL2 options and settings.
  - A new GUI tool has been added to configure APL2 using the .INI file.
  - New invocation options -p11 and -207fl correspond to the
    environment variables APLP11 and APL207FL.
  - A negative value may be passed to the -id parameter, indicating that
    the first available id number starting with the specified value
    should be used.
  - APL2 will load its fonts automatically on invocation if they are
    not installed in Windows.
  - The -pw invocation option allows specification of the default value
    for the print width.

 Documentation
  - The APL2 on-line manuals, including the APL2 Language Reference,
    are now provided in Adobe PDF format.
  - A new book, "APL2 Programming: GUI Application Development", has been
    added to the APL2 library.  This book includes step-by-step instructions
    for building typical GUI applications.  In addition, it contains
    complete reference information about APL2's GUI programming facilities
    for Windows.
  - A new on-line document has been added to Workstation APL2.
    "APL2 Programming: Using APL2 with WebSphere*" gives step-by-step
    instructions, with examples, for creating a WebSphere application
    that uses APL2.
  - A new section has been added to the User's Guide COM documentation,
    to demonstrate transferring Visual Basic macros between APL2 and
    the Microsoft Office environment.

 Interpreter
  - The following deviations from the APL2 Language Reference
    have been removed:
    - QuadPW is now a session variable
    - The maximum rank of an array has been increased from 63 to 64
    - Comments are now allowed after system commands
    - When displaying nested arrays (default display and monadic format),
      in columns with both numeric and character data, the character data
      is right-justified.  In columns with only non-numeric data,
      character data is left-justified.
    - When results of disclose, expand, replicate and take require the
      use of fill items, the added items will use the prototypes
      for the first element of the correct dimension rather than always
      using the prototype of the first element of the array.
    - The results from partition when one or both arguments are null
      are the correct depth and shape as defined by the language.
    - The depth of the result of monadic format of nested arrays is at
      most two, instead of taking the depth of the argument.
    - Enlist supported in selective specification
    - Fill functions for Each and Outer Product
    - Identity functions for Reduce
    - Allow localization of system function names
    - Factorial, Binomal for complex arguments
    - Domino for complex arguments
    - Support identity items with defined operators
    - Do not display insignificant parts of complex numbers
  - 4-byte characters are now allowed in function and operator
    definitions, in both comments and character constants, and will
    be correctly handled by 2 QuadTF, QuadFX, QuadCR, )IN and )OUT.
    4-byte characters are useful in countries such as Japan, that
    have extended character sets.
  - The limit on the number of names on the left of the assignment
    arrow when using vector specification has been lifted.
  - Function line length limit increases to 32767
  - Execute Controlled system function (QuadEC) returns full stack
    information on error
  - Maximum length of simple workspace name increased from 8 to 64
  - Retain 4-byte characters in QuadEM and QuadEC error results
  - Improve performance of encode and decode
  - Add special cases to Compress/Replicate/Expand for performance
  - The performance of the Find primitive is improved for
    right arguments of rank 2 or higher.
  - Performance of the index of, member and without primitives is
    improved for vectors of integer vectors
  - Unicode option for )EDITOR name
  - Performance of monadic Grade on matrices improved
  - Special case for TAKE/DROP on APVs improves performance

    classed as local names.  Labels are a new class.
  - Two new buttons have been added to the Session Manager, Object Editor
    and File Editor toolbars, to allow control of the "Partial Line Marking"
    and "APL" settings.
  - The "Lines From/To" option is enabled in the Print dialog for the
    session maanger and editors.  This option allows specification of
    a range of lines to be printed.  If no lines are marked, the default
    range for the session manager is set to the last 150 lines.
    The default for the editors is set to all lines.
  - New system option "Objects Inherit Background Color" can be selected
    to request that editor sessions take the same background color as the
    session manger window from which they were started.

    the session manager and editor windows and supports highlighting all
    occurances of the find text.
  - "Localize all" and "Unlocalize all" actions have been added to the
    Object Editor's popup menu when editing a function or operator.
    These actions localize or unlocalize all the names on a line.
  - Unicode fonts may be selected for use in the APL2 Session Manager
    and editor windows.
  - Windows themes will be recognized and used in all APL2 GUI windows.
  - File Editor, Library Manager, and SVP Monitor buttons have been added

    This invocation option sets the default isolation level for the
    APL2 session.  Note: isolation level can also be changed dynamically
    using the AP command 'ISOL'.
  - Two new commands have been added to AP 227:
    - ODBC retrieves information about available datasources or drivers.
    - ODBCOPEN sets up an SQL table containing information about
      the tables or supported datatypes of the current database.
  - Support is added for an indicator to be used with value list indices to
    request processing of data with the BLOB (Binary Large Object) SQL type.
    In the following SQL statement
          INSERT INTO TABLE (CHARCOL, BLOBCOL) VALUES (:1, :B2)
    the use of the letter B (:B2) indicates that AP 127 should use
    the BLOB type when passing the associated data to DB2
  - AP 127's restrictions on the length of the id and password parameters
    to CONNECT have been lifted.  (The database system may still impose
    its own restrictions).
  - AP 127 and AP 227 will recognize and fetch the XML column datatype.
    'X' is returned as the datatype indicator in DESCRIBE output.
  - AP 127 and AP 227 are enhanced to allow calls to Stored
    Procedures, including support for output parameters and
    result set fetching.  The SQL workspace is also updated to
    handle these calls, through the SQL function and with a new
    high-level function PROCEDURE.
  - Support for DECFLOAT datatype

 Dialog Editor/AP 145/DEMO145/GUITOOLS
  - a new Grid Control has been added
  - the MLE "wordwrap" style is now supported
  - The Grid control has been enhanced to support numeric data.
  - Dynamic Control Creation
    Controls can now be created dynamically without using the dialog
    editor or dialog templates.  The CREATEDLG function accepts a
    character vector containing a list of dialog styles. The new
    CREATECTL function is used to create controls.
  - Positioning and Sizing Aids
    New Properties:
       CLIENT POSITION positions control relative to parent's client area.
       CLIENT SIZE resizes a dialog to produce a specified client area size.
       MAXIMUM SIZE, MINIMUM SIZE specify a dialog's resizing limits.
       OFFSET indicates how controls should be resized as dialogs are resized.
       SPLIT positions a dialog split bar.
       STATE MINMAX minimizes, maximizes and restores dialogs.
    New Functions:
       SIZETOTEXT resizes a control to fit its data.
       CENTER_CHILD centers a control within its parent's client area.
  - Printing Facilities
    PRINT_PROPERTY function used to get and set print job properties
    Properties supported:
       ORIENTATION indicates portrait or landscape paper orientation
       PAPER SIZE returns size of paper
       POSITION indicates position on page of next output
       MINIMUM MARGINS returns minimum margins supported by printer
       MARGINS indicates margins used in print job
  - STATE APL property enables APL keyboard input
  - PICTURE property sets dialog icon
  - Listbox and Combobox Sort style maintains data in alphabetical order
  - 3state Check Boxes supported
  - GETPARENT, GETCHILDREN functions return handles of parents and children

    the inclusion of file and directory information in dialogs.
  - Support has been added for dialog scroll bar events.
  - New STATE LIST VISIBLE property controls whether the list portion
    of combo boxes is visible.
  - New PRINTERS, PRINTER and FILENAME properties for print objects

 AP 210
    Improved performance accessing linefeed-delimited files

 EXECUTE_APL Callback Service
    A new callback service is provided for external functions written
    to the :link.FUNCTION protocol.  EXECUTE_APL allows external
    functions to request execution of APL expressions and functions.

 Processor 10
    Performance of the built-in file functions is improved

 Processor 11
  - Support is added for searching more than one names file for an
    external routine's descriptor.  Where a single file name was
    previously provided, multiple file names separated by ; (semi-colon)
    may now be provided.
  - Null-terminated strings of two-byte characters are supported in
    patterns specified for ATR, RTA, Procssor 15, and arguments to
    non-APL external routines.

 Processor 12
  - A new pattern, 'C1 1 *', is supported when associating a name with a
    text file (type 'F').  This pattern specifies that the view of the
    file in APL2 will be a simple character vector (byte stream).
  - Five new pattern types (C2, C4, I4, E8 and J16) are supported
    by Processor 12 when viewing a file as a simple vector.
  - Performance of association to lf-delimited files is improved.
  - The amount of temporary storage required for write operations to
    APL files is reduced by half.

 Processor 14/Java Interfaces
  - A new associated processor, Processor 14, provides the ability
    to call Java from APL2.
  - A new invocation option to APL2, -javaxmx, allows control of the
    size of the memory heap used by the Java Virtual Machine started by
    the APL2 Java interfaces.
  - Java objects may now be passed directly to APL2, instead of being
    converted to APL2 objects.
  - Return Java exception through P14

 Processor 15
  - This new associated processor provides access to storage outside
    the APL2 workspace using variable names in the workspace. The
    storage is formatted into APL2 data structures by Processor 15
    based on a user-provided pattern.
  - Arbitrary arrays are supported with the '' pattern
  - Variable monitor expressions can be established

 Visual Basic Interface
  - "Assign" has been added the set of functions provided for calling APL2
    from Visual Basic.  It allows you to directly assign a name to an object.
  - Support is added for passing parameters by reference ("ByRef")

 Supplied External Routines
  - A new external function provides access to Microsoft Component Object
    Model (COM) objects from APL2.  COM is an object-oriented protocol
    that is supported by many Windows programs, including the Microsoft
    Office suite of products.
  - A new set of external functions provides workspace compression
    facilities.  The ZIP and UNZIP functions operate on individual APL
    arrays, and the ZIPWS and UNZIPWS functions operate on the entire
    workspace.  Note: these functions use the APL2 Java interfaces.
  - A new external function, TCL, provides an interface to the Tcl/Tk
    language.
  - The TIME function from 1 TIME and the DISPLAY, DISPLAYC and DISPLAYG
    functions from 1 DISPLAY have been placed in a new namespace shipped
    with APL2.  You can access these functions via name association:
       3 11 NA 'TIME'
       3 11 NA 'DISPLAY'
  - The ATR and RTA external functions have been extended to support a
    monadic syntax.  If ATR is called without a left argument, it uses
    Common Data Representation (CDR) format to create its result.  If RTA
    is called without a left argument, it will treat its right argument
    as a CDR.  RTA will support the CDR format of both workstation and
    mainframe APL2.
 -  The follow new external functions have been added:
    CHECK_ERROR gets the text associated with a system error number.
                This function is a replacement for the APL function
                in the AIX, LINUX and SOLARIS workspaces, and is
                available for all platforms. An association to this
                function has been added to the WINDOWS workspace.
    OPTION      queries and sets APL2 invocation and session options.
    PRINTWSG    is a version of PRINTWS with a GUI user interface.
 -  The following functions from the supplied workspaces have been
    moved into namespaces and are available as external functions.
    The namespace versions of the functions are platform-independent:
    From WINDOWS:
      DIR         Return a directory listing
      ERASE       Erase a file
      HOST        Execute a operating system command
      LIBS        Return the list of defined APL2 workspace libraries
      MKDIR       Make a directory
      PIPE        Redirect input and output to a command
      RENAME      Rename a file
      RMDIR       Remove a directory

    From IDIOMS:
      IDIOMS      Display commonly used APL2 phrases
    From WSCOMP:
      WSCOMP      Workspace comparison tool
      WSCOMP_ANALYZE
  - Three new external routines provide program access to the
    functionality of the APL2 system commands )COPY, )PCOPY and )LIB.
    The COPY, PCOPY and LIB functions are accessed via Processor 11
    and take a character string argument with the same syntax as their
    corresponding system commands.
  - Four new namespaces contain the contents of the public library 2
    workspaces FILE, GRAPHPAK, MATHFNS and SQL.  The namespaces
    are an alternative way to use the objects in these workspaces
    without making local copies of them and without name conflicts.
  - Support for events is added to the COM external function. You can
    query the available events for a COM object, request notification
    when events occur, and wait for notification of events.
  - When passed a null right argument, the OPTION external function
    will return the APL2 command line.
  - Unicode filenames are accepted by  FILE and FSTAT
  - Output parameters are supported by COM
  - TIME 4 queries the current state of timing
  - New external function REPLACEX is a high-performance routine to
    replace instances of a string or strings in a character vector.
  - Namespace versions of the GUITOOLS and GUIVARS workspaces
    are shipped with the APL2 product.
  - New DATATYPE function returns information about the internal type
    of data objects in the APL2 workspace.  It is compatible with
    the new mainframe APL2 function of the same name.
  - New PEACHP and PEACHT operators allow automatic distribution of
    computation across multiple processors.
  - ROUNDC external function provides high-performance commercial rounding
  - Configure APL2 supports browsing for path and file names
  - IDIOMSG provides a GUI interface to the APL2 Idioms Library.

    On Windows, the deleted file will be sent to the recycle bin.
  - LEXP is a lexical parsing facility that analyzes a
    character vector using the APL2 syntax rules.
  - SI and SIS provide program access to the APL2 stack
  - The RF external function is extended to handle nested matrices
    whose subitems are all character and/or integer arrays of any rank.
  - The SCANDIR function gets directory listings without use of an
    operating system shell.
  - GMTSTAMP function allows setting function timestamps under program control

 Workspaces
  DEMOJAVA
  - JAVAMAIL_SEND function to send emails
  - XML2APL and APL2XML tools parse and create XML
  - JAVA_PRINT prints APL objects using Java faclities
  - XML2APL adds support for DTD addresses
  GRAPHPAK
  - New function OPENGP145 supports opening the graphics window within
    an AP 145 dialog.
  WSCOMP
  - The Windows GUI interface of the WSCOMP workspace has been enhanced
    to allow specification of a user-selected compare program.
  - Compare objects containing Unicode data
  - Use summary window status area for warning messages
  - Copy name to clipboard on summary screen

 Installation
  - On NT-based Windows systems, administrator authority will not be
    required to install APL2 for a single user.
  - The option to add an APL2 program icon on the desktop will be offered.
  - The default install directory path will be obtained by querying
    the system, allowing for national language differences.
