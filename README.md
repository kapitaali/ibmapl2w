YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS EULA BY INSTALLING, COPYING, OR
OTHERWISE USING THE SOFTWARE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO NOT INSTALL, COPY, OR USE
THE SOFTWARE; YOU MAY RETURN IT TO YOUR PLACE OF PURCHASE (IF APPLICABLE) FOR A
FULL REFUND.

MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE
1. GRANTS OF LICENSE. Microsoft grants you the rights described in this EULA
   provided that you comply with all terms and conditions of this EULA. NOTE:
   Microsoft is not licensing to you any rights with respect to Crystal Reports
   for Microsoft Visual Studio .NET; your use of Crystal Reports for Microsoft
   Visual Studio .NET is subject to your acceptance of the terms and conditions
   of the enclosed (hard copy) end user license agreement from Crystal Decisions
   for that product.

       1.1 General License Grant. Microsoft grants to you as an individual, a
       personal, nonexclusive license to use the Software, and to make and use
       copies of the Software for the purposes of designing, developing,
       testing, and demonstrating your software product(s), provided that you
       are the only individual using the Software.

             If you are an entity, Microsoft grants to you a personal,
             nonexclusive license to use the Software, and to make and use
             copies of the Software, provided that for each individual using the
             Software within your organization, you have acquired a separate and
             valid license for each such individual.

       1.2 Documentation. You may make and use an unlimited number of copies of
       any documentation, provided that such copies shall be used only for
       personal purposes and are not to be republished or distributed (either in

       1.3 Storage/Network Use. You may also store or install a copy of the
       Software on a storage device, such as a network server, used only to
       install or run the Software on computers used by licensed end users in
       accordance with Section 1.1. A single license for the Software may not be
       shared or used concurrently by multiple end users.

       1.4 Visual Studio--Effect of EULA. As a suite of development tools and
       other Microsoft software programs (each such tool or software program, a
       "Component"), Components that you receive as part of the Software may
       include a separate end-user license agreement (each, a "Component EULA").
       Except as provided in Section 4 ("Prerelease Code"), in the event of
       inconsistencies between this EULA and any Component EULA, the terms of
       this EULA shall control. The Software may also contain thirdparty
       software programs. Any such software is provided for your use as a
       convenience and your use is subject to the terms and conditions of any
       license agreement contained in that software.

2. ADDITIONAL LICENSE RIGHTS -- REDISTRIBUTABLE CODE. In addition to the rights
   granted in Section 1, certain portions of the Software, as described in this
   Section 2, are provided to you with additional license rights. These
   additional license rights are conditioned upon your compliance with the
   distribution requirements and license limitations described in Section 3.

       2.1 Sample Code. Microsoft grants you a limited, nonexclusive,
       royalty-free license to: (a) use and modify the source code version of
       those portions of the Software identified as "Samples" in REDIST.TXT or
       elsewhere in the Software ("Sample Code") for the sole purposes of
       designing, developing, and testing your software product(s), and
       (b) reproduce and distribute the Sample Code, along with any
       modifications thereof, in object and/or source code form. For applicable
       redistribution requirements for Sample Code, see Section 3.1 below.

       2.2 Redistributable Code--General. Microsoft grants you a limited,
       nonexclusive, royalty-free license to reproduce and distribute the object
       code form of any portion of the Software listed in REDIST.TXT
       ("Redistributable Code"). For general redistribution requirements for
       Redistributable Code, see Section 3.1 below.

       2.3 Redistributable Code--Microsoft Merge Modules ("MSM"). Microsoft
       grants you a limited, nonexclusive, royalty-free license to reproduce and
       distribute the content of MSM file(s) listed in REDIST.TXT in the manner
       described in the Software documentation only so long as you redistribute
       such content in its entirety and do not modify such content in any way.
       For all other applicable redistribution requirements for MSM files, see
       Section 3.1 below.

       2.4 Redistributable Code--Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), Active
       Template Libraries (ATL), and C runtimes (CRTs). In addition to the
       rights granted in Section 1, Microsoft grants you a license to use and
       modify the source code version of those portions of the Software that are
       identified as MFC, ATL, or CRTs (collectively, the "VC
       Redistributables"), for the sole purposes of designing, developing, and
       testing your software product(s). Provided you comply with Section 3.1
       and you rename any files created by you that are included in the Licensee
       Software (defined below), Microsoft grants you a limited, nonexclusive,
       royalty-free license to reproduce and distribute the object code version
       of the VC Redistributables, including any modifications you make. For
       purposes of this section, "modifications" shall mean enhancements to the
       functionality of the VC Redistributables. For all other applicable
       redistribution requirements for VC Redistributables, see Section 3.1
       below.

3. DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER LICENSE RIGHTS AND LIMITATIONS. If you
   choose to exercise your rights under Section 2, any redistribution by you is
   subject to your compliance with Section 3.1; some of the Redistributable Code
   has additional limited use rights described in Section 3.2.

       3.1 General Distribution Requirements.

             (a) If you choose to redistribute Sample Code, or Redistributable
             Code (collectively, the "Redistributables") as described in Section
             2, you agree: (i) except as otherwise noted in Section 2.1 (Sample
             Code), to distribute the Redistributables only in object code form
             and in conjunction with and as a part of a software application
             product developed by you that adds significant and primary
             functionality to the Redistributables ("Licensee Software");
             (ii) that the Redistributables only operate in conjunction with
             Microsoft Windows platforms; (iii) that if the Licensee Software is
             distributed beyond Licensee's premises or externally from
             Licensee's organization, to distribute the Licensee Software
             containing the Redistributables pursuant to an end user license
             agreement (which may be "break-the-seal", "click-wrap" or signed),
             with terms no less protective than those contained in this EULA;
             (iv) not to use Microsoft's name, logo, or trademarks to market the
             Licensee Software; (v) to display your own valid copyright notice
             which shall be sufficient to protect Microsoft's copyright in the
             Software; (vi) not to remove or obscure any copyright, trademark or
             patent notices that appear on the Software as delivered to you;
             (vii) to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Microsoft from and
             against any claims or lawsuits, including attorney's fees, that
             arise or result from the use or distribution of the Licensee
             Software; (viii) to otherwise comply with the terms of this EULA;
             and (ix) agree that Microsoft reserves all rights not expressly
             granted.

             You also agree not to permit further distribution of the
             Redistributables by your end users except you may permit further
             redistribution of the Redistributables by your distributors to your
             end-user customers if your distributors only distribute the
             Redistributables in conjunction with, and as part of, the Licensee
             Software, you comply with all other terms of this EULA, and your
             distributors comply with all restrictions of this EULA that are
             applicable to you.

             (b) If you use the Redistributables, then in addition to your
             compliance with the applicable distribution requirements described
             for the Redistributables, the following also applies. Your license
             rights to the Redistributables are conditioned upon your not (i)
             creating derivative works of the Redistributables in any manner
             that would cause the Redistributables in whole or in part to become
             subject to any of the terms of an Excluded License; or (ii)
             distributing the Redistributables (or derivative works thereof) in
             any manner that would cause the Redistributables to become subject
             to any of the terms of an Excluded License. An "Excluded License"
             is any license that requires as a condition of use, modification
             and/or distribution of software subject to the Excluded License,
             that such software or other software combined and/or distributed
             with such software be (x) disclosed or distributed in source code
             form; (y) licensed for the purpose of making derivative works; or
             (z) redistributable at no charge.

             3.2 Additional Distribution Requirements for Certain
             Redistributable Code. If you choose to redistribute the files
             discussed in this Section, then in addition to the terms of Section
             3.1, you must ALSO comply with the following.

       (a) Microsoft SQL Server Desktop Engine ("MSDE"). If you redistribute
       MSDE you agree to comply with the following additional requirements:
       (a) Licensee Software shall not substantially duplicate the capabilities
       of Microsoft Access or, in the reasonable opinion of Microsoft, compete
       with same; and (b) unless Licensee Software requires your customers to
       license Microsoft Access in order to operate, you shall not reproduce or
       use MSDE for commercial distribution in conjunction with a general
       purpose word processing, spreadsheet or database management software
       product, or an integrated work or product suite whose components include
       a general purpose word processing, spreadsheet, or database management
       software product except for the exclusive use of importing data to the
       various formats supported by Microsoft Access. A product that includes
       limited word processing, spreadsheet or database components along with
       other components which provide significant and primary value, such as an
       accounting product with limited spreadsheet capability, is not considered
       to be a "general purpose" product.

        (b) Microsoft Data Access Components. If you redistribute the Microsoft
        Data Access Component file identified as MDAC_TYP.EXE, you also agree to
        redistribute such file in object code only in conjunction with and as a
        part of a Licensee Software developed by you with a Microsoft
        development tool product that adds significant and primary functionality
        to MDAC_TYP.EXE.

       3.3 Separation of Components. The Software is licensed as a single
       product. Its component parts may not be separated for use by more than
       one user.

       3.4 Benchmark Testing. The Software may contain the Microsoft .NET
       Framework. You may not disclose the results of any benchmark test of the
       .NET Framework component of the Software to any third party without
       Microsoft's prior written approval.

4. PRERELEASE CODE. Portions of the Software may be identified as prerelease
   code ("Prerelease Code"). Such Prerelease Code is not at the level of
   performance and compatibility of the final, generally available product
   offering. The Prerelease Code may not operate correctly and may be
   substantially modified prior to first commercial shipment. Microsoft is not
   obligated to make this or any later version of the Prerelease Code
   commercially available. The grant of license to use Prerelease Code expires
   upon availability of a commercial release of the Prerelease Code from
   Microsoft. NOTE: In the event that Prerelease Code contains a separate
   end-user license agreement, the terms and conditions of such end-user license
   agreement shall govern your use of the corresponding Prerelease Code.

5. RESERVATION OF RIGHTS AND OWNERSHIP. Microsoft reserves all rights not
   expressly granted to you in this EULA. The Software is protected by copyright
   and other intellectual property laws and treaties. Microsoft or its suppliers
   own the title, copyright, and other intellectual property rights in the
   Software. The Software is licensed, not sold.

6. LIMITATIONS ON REVERSE ENGINEERING, DECOMPILATION, AND DISASSEMBLY. You may
   not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software, except and only
   to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law
   notwithstanding this limitation.

7. NO RENTAL/COMMERCIAL HOSTING. You may not rent, lease, lend or provide
   commercial hosting services with the Software.

8. CONSENT TO USE OF DATA. You agree that Microsoft and its affiliates may
   collect and use technical information gathered as part of the product support
   services provided to you, if any, related to the Software. Microsoft may use
   this information solely to improve our products or to provide customized
   services or technologies to you and will not disclose this information in a
   form that personally identifies you.

9. LINKS TO THIRD PARTY SITES. You may link to third party sites through the use
   of the Software. The third party sites are not under the control of
   Microsoft, and Microsoft is not responsible for the contents of any third
   party sites, any links contained in third party sites, or any changes or
   updates to third party sites. Microsoft is not responsible for webcasting or
   any other form of transmission received from any third party sites. Microsoft
   is providing these links to third party sites to you only as a convenience,
   and the inclusion of any link does not imply an endorsement by Microsoft of
   the third party site.

10. ADDITIONAL SOFTWARE/SERVICES. This EULA applies to updates, supplements,
    add-on components, or Internet-based services components, of the Software
    that Microsoft may provide to you or make available to you after the date
    you obtain your initial copy of the Software, unless we provide other terms
    along with the update, supplement, add-on component, or Internet-based
    services component. Microsoft reserves the right to discontinue any
    Internet-based services provided to you or made available to you through the
    use of the Software.

11. UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES

 11.1 Upgrades. To use a version of the Software identified as an upgrade, you
 must first be licensed for the software identified by Microsoft as eligible for
 the upgrade. After upgrading, you may no longer use the software that formed
 the basis for your upgrade eligibility.

 11.2 Downgrades. Instead of installing and using the Software, you may install
 and use copies of an earlier version of the Software, provided that you
 completely remove such earlier version and install the current version of the
 Software within a reasonable time. Your use of such earlier version shall be
 governed by this EULA, and your rights to use such earlier version shall
 terminate when you install the Software.

 11.3 Special Terms for Version 2003 Upgrade Editions of the Software. If the
 Software accompanying this EULA is the version 2003 edition of the Software and
 you have acquired it as an upgrade from the corresponding "2002" edition of the
 Microsoft software product with the same product name as the Software (the
 "Qualifying Software"), then Section 11.1 does not apply to you. Instead, you
 may continue to use the Qualifying Software AND the version 2003 upgrade for so
 long as you continue to comply with the terms of this EULA and the EULA
 governing your use of the Qualifying Software. Qualifying Software does not
 include non-Microsoft software products.

12. NOT FOR RESALE SOFTWARE. Software identified as "Not For Resale" or "NFR,"
    may not be sold or otherwise transfered for value, or used for any purpose
    other than demonstration, test or evaluation.

13. ACADEMIC EDITION SOFTWARE. To use Software identified as "Academic Edition"
    or "AE," you must be a "Qualified Educational User." For
    qualification-related questions, please contact the Microsoft Sales
    Information Center/One Microsoft Way/Redmond, WA 98052-6399 or the Microsoft
    subsidiary serving your country.

14. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. You acknowledge that the Software is subject to U.S.
    export jurisdiction. You agree to comply with all applicable international
    and national laws that apply to the Software, including the U.S. Export
    Administration Regulations, as well as end-user, end-use, and destination
    restrictions issued by U.S. and other governments. For additional
    information see <http://www.microsoft.com/exporting/>.

15. SOFTWARE TRANSFER. The initial user of the Software may make a one-time
    permanent transfer of this EULA and Software to another end user, provided
    the initial user retains no copies of the Software. This transfer must
    include all of the Software (including all component parts, the media and
    printed materials, any upgrades (including any Qualifying Software as
    defined in Section 11.3), this EULA, and, if applicable, the Certificate of
    Authenticity). The transfer may not be an indirect transfer, such as a
    consignment. Prior to the transfer, the end user receiving the Software must
    agree to all the EULA terms.

16. TERMINATION. Without prejudice to any other rights, Microsoft may terminate
    this EULA if you fail to comply with the terms and conditions of this EULA.
    In such event, you must destroy all copies of the Software and all of its
    component parts.

17. LIMITED WARRANTY FOR SOFTWARE ACQUIRED IN THE US AND CANADA.

Except for the "Redistributables," which are provided AS IS without warranty of
any kind, Microsoft warrants that the Software will perform substantially in
accordance with the accompanying materials for a period of ninety (90) days from
the date of receipt.

If an implied warranty or condition is created by your state/jurisdiction and
federal or state/provincial law prohibits disclaimer of it, you also have an
implied warranty or condition, BUT ONLY AS TO DEFECTS DISCOVERED DURING THE
PERIOD OF THIS LIMITED WARRANTY (NINETY DAYS). AS TO ANY DEFECTS DISCOVERED
AFTER THE NINETYDAY PERIOD, THERE IS NO WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND. Some
states/jurisdictions do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty or
condition lasts, so the above limitation may not apply to you.

Any supplements or updates to the Software, including without limitation, any
(if any) service packs or hot fixes provided to you after the expiration of the
ninety day Limited Warranty period are not covered by any warranty or condition,
express, implied or statutory.

LIMITATION ON REMEDIES; NO CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER DAMAGES. Your exclusive remedy
for any breach of this Limited Warranty is as set forth below. Except for any
refund elected by Microsoft, YOU ARE NOT ENTITLED TO ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT
NOT LIMITED TO CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, if the Software does not meet Microsoft's
Limited Warranty, and, to the maximum extent allowed by applicable law, even if
any remedy fails of its essential purpose. The terms of Section 19 ("Exclusion
of Incidental, Consequential and Certain Other Damages") are also incorporated
into this Limited Warranty. Some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion
or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or
exclusion may not apply to you. This Limited Warranty gives you specific legal
rights. You may have other rights which vary from state/jurisdiction to
state/jurisdiction. YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. Microsoft's and its suppliers' entire
liability and your exclusive remedy for any breach of this Limited Warranty or
for any other breach of this EULA or for any other liability relating to the
Software shall be, at Microsoft's option from time to time exercised subject to
applicable law, (a) return of the amount paid (if any) for the Software, or
(b) repair or replacement of the Software, that does not meet this Limited
Warranty and that is returned to Microsoft with a copy of your receipt. You will
receive the remedy elected by Microsoft without charge, except that you are
responsible for any expenses you may incur (e.g. cost of shipping the Software
to Microsoft). This Limited Warranty is void if failure of the Software has
resulted from accident, abuse, misapplication, abnormal use or a virus. Any
replacement Software will be warranted for the remainder of the original
warranty period or thirty (30) days, whichever is longer, and Microsoft will use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide your remedy within a commercially
reasonable time of your compliance with Microsoft's warranty remedy procedures.
Outside the United States or Canada, neither these remedies nor any product
support services offered by Microsoft are available without proof of purchase
from an authorized international source. To exercise your remedy, contact:
Microsoft, Attn. Microsoft Sales Information Center/One Microsoft Way/Redmond,
WA 98052-6399, or the Microsoft subsidiary serving your country.

18. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES. The Limited Warranty that appears above is the
    only express warranty made to you and is provided in lieu of any other
    express warranties or similar obligations (if any) created by any
    advertising, documentation, packaging, or other communications. EXCEPT FOR
    THE LIMITED WARRANTY AND TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
    MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS PROVIDE THE SOFTWARE AND SUPPORT SERVICES (IF
    ANY) AS IS AND WITH ALL FAULTS, AND HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND
    CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
    LIMITED TO, ANY (IF ANY) IMPLIED WARRANTIES, DUTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
    MERCHANTABILITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF RELIABILITY OR
    AVAILABILITY, OF ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF RESPONSES, OF RESULTS, OF
    WORKMANLIKE EFFORT, OF LACK OF VIRUSES, AND OF LACK OF NEGLIGENCE, ALL WITH
    REGARD TO THE SOFTWARE, AND THE PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT
    OR OTHER SERVICES, INFORMATION, SOFTWARE, AND RELATED CONTENT THROUGH THE
    SOFTWARE OR OTHERWISE ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE. ALSO, THERE IS
    NO WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, QUIET POSSESSION,
    CORRESPONDENCE TO DESCRIPTION OR NON-INFRINGEMENT WITH REGARD TO THE
    SOFTWARE.

19. EXCLUSION OF INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL AND CERTAIN OTHER DAMAGES. TO THE
    MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL MICROSOFT OR
    ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, INDIRECT, OR
    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR
    LOSS OF PROFITS OR CONFIDENTIAL OR OTHER INFORMATION, FOR BUSINESS
    INTERRUPTION, FOR PERSONAL INJURY, FOR LOSS OF PRIVACY, FOR FAILURE TO MEET
    ANY DUTY INCLUDING OF GOOD FAITH OR OF REASONABLE CARE, FOR NEGLIGENCE, AND
    FOR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY OR OTHER LOSS WHATSOEVER) ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY
    WAY RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, THE PROVISION OF
    OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT OR OTHER SERVICES, INFORMATION, SOFTWARE, AND
    RELATED CONTENT THROUGH THE SOFTWARE OR OTHERWISE ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF
    THE SOFTWARE, OR OTHERWISE UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY PROVISION OF THIS
    EULA, EVEN IN THE EVENT OF THE FAULT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE),
    MISREPRESENTATION, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF CONTRACT OR BREACH OF
    WARRANTY OF MICROSOFT OR ANY SUPPLIER, AND EVEN IF MICROSOFT OR ANY SUPPLIER
    HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

20. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND REMEDIES. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY DAMAGES THAT YOU
    MIGHT INCUR FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL
    DAMAGES REFERENCED HEREIN AND ALL DIRECT OR GENERAL DAMAGES IN CONTRACT OR
    ANYTHING ELSE), THE ENTIRE LIABILITY OF MICROSOFT AND ANY OF ITS SUPPLIERS
    UNDER ANY PROVISION OF THIS EULA AND YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY HEREUNDER (EXCEPT
    FOR ANY REMEDY OF REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT ELECTED BY MICROSOFT WITH RESPECT TO

Si vous avez acquis votre produit Microsoft au CANADA, la garantie limitée
suivante s'applique :

## GARANTIE LIMITÉE

Sauf pur celles du "Redistributables," qui sont fournies "comme telles,"
Microsoft garantit que le Logiciel fonctionnera conformément aux documents
inclus pendant une période de 90 jours suivant la date de réception.

Si une garantie ou condition implicite est créée par votre État ou votre
territoire et qu'une loi fédérale ou provinciale ou d'un État en interdit le
déni, vous jouissez également d'une garantie ou condition implicite, MAIS
UNIQUEMENT POUR LES DÉFAUTS DÉCOUVERTS DURANT LA PÉRIODE DE LA PRÉSENTE GARANTIE
LIMITÉE (QUATRE-VINGT-DIX JOURS). IL N'Y A AUCUNE GARANTIE OU CONDITION DE
QUELQUE NATURE QUE CE SOIT QUANT AUX DÉFAUTS DÉCOUVERTS APRÈS CETTE PÉRIODE DE
QUATRE-VINGT-DIX JOURS. Certains États ou territoires ne permettent pas de
limiter la durée d'une garantie ou condition implicite de sorte que la
limitation ci­dessus peut ne pas s'appliquer à vous.

Tous les suppléments ou toutes les mises à jour relatifs au Logiciel, notamment,
les ensembles de services ou les réparations à chaud (le cas échéant) qui vous
sont fournis après l'expiration de la période de quatre-vingt-dix jours de la
garantie limitée ne sont pas couverts par quelque garantie ou condition que ce
soit, expresse, implicite ou en vertu de la loi.

LIMITATION DES RECOURS; ABSENCE DE DOMMAGES INDIRECTS OU AUTRES. Votre recours
exclusif pour toute violation de la présente garantie limitée est décrit
ci­après. Sauf pour tout remboursement au choix de Microsoft, si le Logiciel ne
respecte pas la garantie limitée de Microsoft et, dans la mesure maximale
permise par les lois applicables, même si tout recours n'atteint pas son but
essentiel, VOUS N'AVEZ DROIT À AUCUNS DOMMAGES, NOTAMMENT DES DOMMAGES
INDIRECTS. Les termes de la clause «Exclusion des dommages accessoires,
indirects et de certains autres dommages » sont également intégrées à la
présente garantie limitée. Certains États ou territoires ne permettent pas
l'exclusion ou la limitation des dommages indirects ou accessoires de sorte que
la limitation ou l'exclusion ci­dessus peut ne pas s'appliquer à vous. La
présente garantie limitée vous donne des droits légaux spécifiques. Vous pouvez
avoir d'autres droits qui peuvent varier d'un territoire ou d'un État à un
autre. VOTRE RECOURS EXCLUSIF. La seule responsabilité obligation de Microsoft
et de ses fournisseurs et votre recours exclusif pour toute violation de la
présente garantie limitée ou pour toute autre violation du présent contrat ou
pour toute autre responsabilité relative au Logiciel seront, selon le choix de
Microsoft exercé de temps à autre sous réserve de toute loi applicable, a) le
remboursement du prix payé, le cas échéant, pour le Logiciel ou b) la réparation
ou le remplacement du Logiciel qui ne respecte pas la présente garantie limitée
et qui est retourné à Microsoft avec une copie de votre reçu. Vous recevrez la
compensation choisie par Microsoft, sans frais, sauf que vous êtes responsable
des dépenses que vous pourriez engager (p. ex., les frais d'envoi du Logiciel à
Microsoft). La présente garantie limitée est nulle si la défectuosité du
Logiciel est causée par un accident, un usage abusif, une mauvaise application,
un usage anormal ou un virus. Tout Logiciel de remplacement sera garanti pour le
reste de la période initiale de la garantie ou pendant trente (30) jours, selon
la plus longue entre ces deux périodes. À l'extérieur des États-Unis ou du
Canada, ces recours ou l'un quelconque des services de soutien technique offerts
par Microsoft ne sont pas disponibles sans preuve d'achat d'une source
internationale autorisée. Pour exercer votre recours, vous devez communiquer
avec Microsoft et vous adresser au Microsoft Sales Information Center/One
Microsoft Way/Redmond, WA 98052-6399, ou à la filiale de Microsoft de votre
pays.

DÉNI DE GARANTIES. La garantie limitée qui apparaît ci-dessus constitue la seule
garantie expresse qui vous est donnée et remplace toutes autres garanties
expresses (s'il en est) crées par une publicité, un document, un emballage ou
une autre communication. SAUF EN CE QUI A TRAIT À LA GARANTIE LIMITÉE ET DANS LA
MESURE MAXIMALE PERMISE PAR LES LOIS APPLICABLES, LE LOGICIEL ET LES SERVICES DE
SOUTIEN TECHNIQUE (LE CAS ÉCHÉANT) SONT FOURNIS TELS QUELS ET AVEC TOUS LES
DÉFAUTS PAR MICROSOFT ET SES FOURNISSEURS, LESQUELS PAR LES PRÉSENTES DÉNIENT
TOUTES AUTRES GARANTIES ET CONDITIONS EXPRESSES, IMPLICITES OU EN VERTU DE LA
LOI, NOTAMMENT, MAIS SANS LIMITATION, (LE CAS ÉCHÉANT) LES GARANTIES, DEVOIRS OU
CONDITIONS IMPLICITES DE QUALITÉ MARCHANDE, D'ADAPTATION À UNE FIN PARTICULIÈRE,
DE FIABILITÉ OU DE DISPONIBILITÉ, D'EXACTITUDE OU D'EXHAUSTIVITÉ DES RÉPONSES,
DES RÉSULTATS, DES EFFORTS DÉPLOYÉS SELON LES RÈGLES DE L'ART, D'ABSENCE DE
VIRUS ET D'ABSENCE DE NÉGLIGENCE, LE TOUT À L'ÉGARD DU LOGICIEL ET DE LA

SERVICES, RENSEIGNEMENTS, LOGICIELS, ET CONTENU QUI S'Y RAPPORTE GRÂCE AU
LOGICIEL OU PROVENANT AUTREMENT DE L'UTILISATION DU LOGICIEL . PAR AILLEURS, IL
N'Y A AUCUNE GARANTIE OU CONDITION QUANT AU TITRE DE PROPRIÉTÉ, À LA JOUISSANCE
OU LA POSSESSION PAISIBLE, À LA CONCORDANCE À UNE DESCRIPTION NI QUANT À UNE
ABSENCE DE CONTREFAÇON CONCERNANT LE LOGICIEL.

EXCLUSION DES DOMMAGES ACCESSOIRES, INDIRECTS ET DE CERTAINS AUTRES DOMMAGES.
DANS LA MESURE MAXIMALE PERMISE PAR LES LOIS APPLICABLES, EN AUCUN CAS MICROSOFT
OU SES FOURNISSEURS NE SERONT RESPONSABLES DES DOMMAGES SPÉCIAUX, CONSÉCUTIFS,
ACCESSOIRES OU INDIRECTS DE QUELQUE NATURE QUE CE SOIT (NOTAMMENT, LES DOMMAGES

COMPRIS D'AGIR DE BONNE FOI OU D'EXERCER UN SOIN RAISONNABLE, DE LA NÉGLIGENCE
ET DE TOUTE AUTRE PERTE PÉCUNIAIRE OU AUTRE PERTE DE QUELQUE NATURE QUE CE SOIT)
SE RAPPORTANT DE QUELQUE MANIÈRE QUE CE SOIT À L'UTILISATION DU LOGICIEL OU À
L'INCAPACITÉ DE S'EN SERVIR, À LA PRESTATION OU À L'OMISSION DE LA PRESTATION DE
SERVICES DE SOUTIEN TECHNIQUE OU À LA FOURNITURE OU À L'OMISSION DE LA
FOURNITURE DE TOUS AUTRES SERVICES, RENSEIGNEMENTS, LOGICIELS, ET CONTENU QUI
S'Y RAPPORTE GRÂCE AU LOGICIEL OU PROVENANT AUTREMENT DE L'UTILISATION DU
LOGICIEL OU AUTREMENT AUX TERMES DE TOUTE DISPOSITION DE LA PRÉSENTE CONVENTION

COMPRIS LA NÉGLIGENCE), DE RESPONSABILITÉ STRICTE, DE VIOLATION DE CONTRAT OU DE
VIOLATION DE GARANTIE DE MICROSOFT OU DE TOUT FOURNISSEUR ET MÊME SI MICROSOFT
OU TOUT FOURNISSEUR A ÉTÉ AVISÉ DE LA POSSIBILITÉ DE TELS DOMMAGES.

LIMITATION DE RESPONSABILITÉ ET RECOURS. MALGRÉ LES DOMMAGES QUE VOUS PUISSIEZ
SUBIR POUR QUELQUE MOTIF QUE CE SOIT (NOTAMMENT, MAIS SANS LIMITATION, TOUS LES
DOMMAGES SUSMENTIONNÉS ET TOUS LES DOMMAGES DIRECTS OU GÉNÉRAUX OU AUTRES), LA
SEULE RESPONSABILITÉ DE MICROSOFT ET DE L'UN OU L'AUTRE DE SES FOURNISSEURS AUX
TERMES DE TOUTE DISPOSITION DE LA PRÉSENTE CONVENTION ET VOTRE RECOURS EXCLUSIF
À L'ÉGARD DE TOUT CE QUI PRÉCÈDE (SAUF EN CE QUI CONCERNE TOUT RECOURS DE
RÉPARATION OU DE REMPLACEMENT CHOISI PAR MICROSOFT À L'ÉGARD DE TOUT MANQUEMENT
À LA GARANTIE LIMITÉE) SE LIMITE AU PLUS ÉLEVÉ ENTRE LES MONTANTS SUIVANTS : LE
MONTANT QUE VOUS AVEZ RÉELLEMENT PAYÉ POUR LE LOGICIEL OU 5,00 $US. LES LIMITES,
EXCLUSIONS ET DÉNIS QUI PRÉCÈDENT (Y COMPRIS LES CLAUSES CI-DESSUS),
S'APPLIQUENT DANS LA MESURE MAXIMALE PERMISE PAR LES LOIS APPLICABLES, MÊME SI
TOUT RECOURS N'ATTEINT PAS SON BUT ESSENTIEL.

À moins que cela ne soit prohibé par le droit local applicable, la présente
Convention est régie par les lois de la province d'Ontario, Canada. Vous
consentez à la compétence des tribunaux fédéraux et provinciaux siégeant à
Toronto, dans la province d'Ontario.

The following MICROSOFT GUARANTEE applies to you if you acquired this Software
in any other country:

Statutory rights not affected - The following guarantee is not restricted to any
territory and does not affect any statutory rights that you may have from your
reseller or from Microsoft if you acquired the Software directly from Microsoft.
If you acquired the Software or any support services in Australia, New Zealand
or Malaysia, please see the "Consumer rights" section below.

The guarantee - The Software is designed and offered as a general-purpose
software, not for any user's particular purpose. You accept that no Software is
error free and you are strongly advised to back-up your files regularly.
Provided that you have a valid license, Microsoft guarantees that a) for a
period of 90 days from the date of receipt of your license to use the Software
or the shortest period permitted by applicable law it will perform substantially
in accordance with the written materials that accompany the Software; and b) any
support services provided by Microsoft shall be substantially as described in
applicable written materials provided to you by Microsoft and Microsoft support
engineers will use reasonable efforts, care and skill to solve any problem
issues. In the event that the Software fails to comply with this guarantee,
Microsoft will either (a) repair or replace the Software or (b) return the price
you paid. This guarantee is void if failure of the Software results from
accident, abuse or misapplication. Any replacement Software will be guaranteed
for the remainder of the original guarantee period or 30 days, whichever period
is longer. You agree that the above guarantee is your sole guarantee in relation
to the Software and any support services.

Exclusion of All Other Terms - To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law
and subject to the guarantee above, Microsoft disclaims all warranties,
conditions and other terms, either express or implied (whether by statute,
common law, collaterally or otherwise) including but not limited to implied
warranties of satisfactory quality and fitness for particular purpose with
respect to the Software and the written materials that accompany the Software.
Any implied warranties that cannot be excluded are limited to 90 days or to the
shortest period permitted by applicable law, whichever is greater.

Limitation of Liability - To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law and
except as provided in the Microsoft Guarantee, Microsoft and its suppliers shall
not be liable for any damages whatsoever (including without limitation, damages
for loss of business profits, business interruption, loss of business
information or other pecuniary loss) arising out of the use or inability to use
the Software, even if Microsoft has been advised of the possibility of such
damages. In any case Microsoft's entire liability under any provision of this
Agreement shall be limited to the amount actually paid by you for the Software.
These limitations do not apply to any liabilities that cannot be excluded or
limited by applicable laws.

Consumer rights - Consumers in Australia, New Zealand or Malaysia may have the
benefit of certain rights and remedies by reason of the Trade Practices Act and
similar state and territory laws in Australia, the Consumer Guarantees Act in
New Zealand and the Consumer Protection Act in Malaysia in respect of which
liability cannot lawfully be modified or excluded. If you acquired the Software
in New Zealand for the purposes of a business, you confirm that the Consumer
Guarantees Act does not apply. If you acquired the Software in Australia and if
Microsoft breaches a condition or warranty implied under any law which cannot
lawfully be modified or excluded by this agreement then, to the extent permitted
by law, Microsoft's liability is limited, at Microsoft's option, to: (i) in the
case of the Software: a) repairing or replacing the Software; or b) the cost of
such repair or replacement; and (ii) in the case of support services: a)
re-supply of the services; or b) the cost of having the services supplied again.

Should you have any questions concerning this EULA, or if you desire to contact
Microsoft for any reason, please use the address information enclosed in this
Software to contact the Microsoft subsidiary serving your country or visit
Microsoft on the World Wide Web at http://www.microsoft.com.
